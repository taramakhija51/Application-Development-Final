# Spotify DJ

This project reorganizes any Spotify playlist via a tool used in DJing called the Camelot key, as well as via BPM as a tiebreaker. It can be used to more smoothly transition between songs in a playlist.
## Setup

1. Start the web server by running `bin/server`.
1. Navigate to your live application preview.
1. Paste in a url for a Spotify playlist (note: it needs to be a playlist URL and not an album or track URL)
